This is a public repository to help teach ourselves about using GitHub and to practice making HTML and CSS pages


                                    !Welcome to one and all!
Following our session today, I had the idea to set up a page that helps teach Github features for beginners.

User Stories:

A user === A student learning web development === anyone who has completed this Scrimba course: https://scrimba.com/learn/htmlandcss

A user should be able to read a markdown file which detail the user stories for this project.
A user should be able to click a button that generates a random set of 'theme' keywords for them to make a website about.
A user should be able to click a second button that suggests HTML Tags and CSS properties which should be included in the website.
A user should be given an automatically generated designed brief based on the generated constraints which they can copy and post to their LinkedIn.

A user should be able to access and refer to a set of instructions which show them how to add their page to this.repository
A user should be able to learn how branches work so that they can independently work on their own pages.
A user should be able to showcase their work on a website generated from this repository


MVP - Minimum Viable Product - 
A single page website that randomly generates idea prompts and suggests HTML tags / CSS properties to be used in the website. It will then automatically generate a design brief based on these constraints which can be  be copied into the users LinkedIn profile.
